        As one of the largest healthcare systems in the United States dedicated solely
        to the care of children and adolescents under the age of 21, the Childrens
        Health Care Delivery Innovation Lab is seeking your help to continue innovating the next
        generation of patient care through hosting a hackathon designed to prototype and test
        solutions to some of the biggest problems in pediatric healthcare. 
      </>,
      <>
        Centering around the themes of access to care and improving patient throughput,
        the Care Innovation Delivery Lab is looking for your ideas! We invite
        all interested to apply for our hackathon and learn from our doctors,
        patient advocates, and other staff members about some of the challenges and
        problems encountered through our experience serving patients. Help us build
        prototypes and new ideas to solve some of the biggest problems we encounter during
        our quest to provide the best possible healthcare for our community. 
      </>,

        We look forward to welcoming you to the Mavs Gaming Hub in Dallas, TX on
        March 28th and 29th to help us innovate the future of healthcare for
        those who desperately need it - free food, snacks, drinks, and an innovative
        environment will be provided to help you come up with the ideas that
        could change our approach to solving some of the biggest problems in pediatric care!

    {
      question: <>
        Are we allowed to build on past projects?
      </>,
      answer: <>
        A hackathon is an experience to build something new within a set amount of time.
        Therefore, you cannot work on past projects. However, using your own
        open-source or third party libraries is fine, so long as the project is new.

        skill sets to cover all the bases of a great idea.
