        As the eighth-largest pediatric health care provider in the country, Children’s 
        Health has a long-standing commitment to the North Texas community that includes 
        not only high-quality patient care but also advocacy, education and preventative 
        care. As part of our ongoing promise to the community, Children’s Health has 
        created the Children’s Health Care Delivery Lab to seek newer and more innovative 
        ways of providing care to our patients. 
      </>,
      <>
        Centering around the themes of <b>access to care and improving patient throughput</b>, 
        the Care Innovation Delivery Lab is looking for your ideas! We invite all those 
        who are interested to apply for our hackathon and learn from our doctors, 
        patient advocates, and other team members about how we can make life better 
        for children by generating innovative solutions that transform how children 
        receive care.  We want your help building prototypes and creating new ideas that 
        will lead to the next wave of clinical breakthroughs in pediatric care.

      question: <>
        Are we allowed to build on past projects?
      </>,
      answer: <>
        A hackathon is an experience to build something new within a set amount of time.
        Therefore, you cannot work on past projects. However, using your own
        open-source or third party libraries is fine, so long as the project is new.
